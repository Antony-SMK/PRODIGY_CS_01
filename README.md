This code represents one of my task from my Internship at Prodigy Infotech. It is a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It Allow users to input a message and
a shift value to perform encryption and decryption. It works on caesar Cipher Algorithm which works in a way 
Write down the plaintext message: HELLO
Choose a shift value. In this case, we will use a shift of 3.
Replace each letter in the plaintext message with the letter that is three positions to the right in the alphabet.
The encrypted message is now “KHOOR”.

******** WORKING OF PROGRAM *************
At the start of program it will ask user to select 'MODE'
There are two modes 'ENCRYPTION' and 'DECRYPTION'
For Encryption enter 'E' and then put shift value and plaintext.
For Decryption enter 'D' and then shift value and ciphertext.
